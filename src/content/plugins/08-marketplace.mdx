## Plugin Marketplace

Discover new plugins, evaluate their usefulness, and learn how to build your own.

---

## Official Marketplace

**Repository:** https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins

All officially supported plugins are hosted here.

### Available Plugins (2026-01)

**Installed (8 essential):**
- ✅ ralph-wiggum - Autonomous iteration loops
- ✅ commit-commands - Git workflow automation
- ✅ frontend-design - Design system enforcement
- ✅ pr-review-toolkit - Comprehensive code review
- ✅ security-guidance - Security monitoring
- ✅ hookify - Custom rule enforcement
- ✅ feature-dev - 7-phase development workflow
- ✅ agent-sdk-dev - Agent development & validation

**Not Installed:**
- code-review - Alternative to pr-review-toolkit (different review agents)
- plugin-dev - For building distributable plugins
- explanatory-output-style - Adds educational context (token-heavy)
- learning-output-style - Interactive learning mode (asks user to code)
- claude-opus-4-5-migration - Model migration tool

<Callout type="info">
**code-review vs pr-review-toolkit:** Both are PR review plugins. code-review focuses on CLAUDE.md compliance, pr-review-toolkit has 6 specialized agents including code-simplifier. You chose pr-review-toolkit.
</Callout>

## Installing from Marketplace

### Default (Official)

```bash
claude plugin install <plugin-name>
```

Installs from the official marketplace automatically.

### Specific Marketplace

```bash
claude plugin install <plugin-name>@<marketplace-name>
```

For third-party or custom marketplaces.

### Examples

```bash
# Official marketplace (default)
claude plugin install ralph-wiggum

# Specific marketplace (if you had one)
claude plugin install my-custom-plugin@company-marketplace
```

---

## Evaluating New Plugins

Before installing a new plugin, consider:

### 1. What Problem Does It Solve?

- Does it automate something you do manually?
- Does it prevent mistakes you've made?
- Does it enforce standards you care about?

**Example:** hookify solves PREFIX naming violations

### 2. What's the Token Cost?

**High Cost:**
- SessionStart hooks (run every session): explanatory-output-style
- Always-active skills: Some aggressive linters

**Low Cost:**
- Commands (only when invoked): commit-commands
- Conditional hooks (only when triggered): security-guidance
- PreToolUse hooks (only before dangerous actions): hookify

<Callout type="warning">
**Token Budget:** SessionStart hooks add overhead to EVERY session. Use sparingly. PreToolUse and command-based plugins are more efficient.
</Callout>

### 3. Does It Conflict?

**Conflicting plugins:**
- code-review ↔ pr-review-toolkit (both do PR review)
- Multiple commit automation plugins
- Overlapping security scanners

**Check before installing:**
```bash
# See what's installed
/help
# Look for similar functionality
```

### 4. Is It Maintained?

Check the official repo:
- Last updated date
- Number of issues/PRs
- Community activity

## Building Your Own Plugins

### When to Build a Plugin

**Good reasons:**
- Workflow specific to your 6-repo setup
- Enforcement rule unique to your conventions
- Integration with internal tools
- Pattern repeated across projects

**Bad reasons:**
- One-off task (just do it directly)
- Already exists in marketplace
- Workflow still evolving (standardize first)

### Plugin Anatomy

**Minimum structure:**
```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json         # Manifest
├── commands/               # Slash commands (optional)
│   └── my-command.sh
├── skills/                 # Auto-invoked skills (optional)
│   └── my-skill.json
├── agents/                 # Specialized agents (optional)
│   └── my-agent.py
├── hooks/                  # Lifecycle hooks (optional)
│   └── pre-tool-use.sh
└── README.md
```

**plugin.json example:**
```json
{
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Does something useful",
  "commands": ["commands/my-command.sh"],
  "skills": ["skills/my-skill.json"],
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": "hooks/pre-tool-use.sh"
  }
}
```

### Using plugin-dev

For building distributable plugins:

```bash
# Install plugin-dev
claude plugin install plugin-dev

# Create new plugin
/plugin-dev:create-plugin

# Follow interactive workflow:
# 1. Choose plugin type
# 2. Select features
# 3. Generate structure
# 4. Implement functionality
# 5. Test locally
# 6. Package for distribution
```

<Callout type="info">
**plugin-dev vs agent-sdk-dev:** plugin-dev builds entire plugins (commands, hooks, agents). agent-sdk-dev builds just agents. For most users, agent-sdk-dev is sufficient.
</Callout>

## Custom Plugin Ideas for Your Workflow

### 1. Cross-Repo Documentation Syncer

**Problem:** CLAUDE.md files across 6 repos get out of sync

**Solution:** Plugin that:
- Scans all repos for CLAUDE.md changes
- Identifies drift from workspace standards
- Suggests syncs
- Auto-updates with approval

**Type:** Command + Agent

### 2. PREFIX Consistency Checker

**Problem:** Different PREFIX patterns across repos

**Solution:** Plugin that:
- Validates PREFIX files in all repos
- Checks sequential numbering
- Ensures title presence
- Reports violations

**Type:** Command (or use ralph-wiggum with hookify)

### 3. Multi-Repo Test Runner

**Problem:** Running tests across 6 repos manually

**Solution:** Plugin that:
- Detects test frameworks in each repo
- Runs tests in parallel
- Aggregates results
- Reports failures

**Type:** Command

### 4. Dependency Audit Reporter

**Problem:** Tracking outdated dependencies across repos

**Solution:** Plugin that:
- Scans package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml
- Checks for outdated deps
- Reports security vulnerabilities
- Suggests updates

**Type:** Skill (auto-invoked when dependencies change)

<Callout type="success">
**Most of these can be solved with ralph-wiggum + existing tools!** Build custom plugins only if you need persistent automation.
</Callout>

## Publishing Plugins

### Internal Use (Your 6 Repos)

**Option 1: User-level installation**
```bash
# Copy plugin to:
~/.claude/plugins/my-plugin/

# Claude Code auto-detects it
```

**Option 2: Repo-level installation**
```bash
# Copy plugin to each repo:
~/projects/data-pipeline/.claude/plugins/my-plugin/
~/projects/content-system/.claude/plugins/my-plugin/
# etc.
```

### Public Distribution

**Steps:**
1. Create plugin following structure
2. Test thoroughly
3. Write comprehensive README
4. Submit PR to official marketplace repo
5. Wait for review and merge

**Requirements:**
- Clear documentation
- Test coverage
- Security review
- Maintainer commitment

## Plugin Maintenance

### Updating Your Installed Plugins

```bash
# Update all plugins
claude plugin update <plugin-name>

# Check for updates
# Visit: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins
```

### Removing Unused Plugins

```bash
# Disable temporarily
claude plugin disable <plugin-name>

# Uninstall permanently
claude plugin uninstall <plugin-name>
```

<Callout type="info">
**Disable vs Uninstall:** Disable keeps the plugin installed but inactive. Uninstall removes it completely. Use disable first to test if you miss it.
</Callout>

## Integration with MCP Servers

**MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers** provide external integrations:
- Database connections
- API access
- File system extensions
- Custom tools

**Plugins vs MCP:**
- **Plugins:** Extend Claude Code behavior (commands, hooks, agents)
- **MCP Servers:** Provide external data/tools to Claude

**They work together:**
```
Plugin (ralph-wiggum)
  → Calls MCP Server (database)
  → Retrieves data
  → Processes it iteratively
```

**MCP documentation:** See `/help` or Claude Code docs for MCP server setup.

## Next Steps

**Explore marketplace:**
Visit https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins

**Try other plugins:**
- code-review (alternative PR review)
- plugin-dev (if building custom plugins)

**Build your own:**
Use `/plugin-dev:create-plugin` if you have a specific workflow to automate

**Share feedback:**
- GitHub issues for bug reports
- PRs for improvements
- Discussions for feature requests

<Callout type="success">
**You're Ready!** You have 8 powerful plugins installed and know how to use them. Start with ralph-wiggum for autonomous work, hookify for enforcement, and the essential plugins for daily workflows.
