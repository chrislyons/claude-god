## commit-commands

Streamline your Git workflow with one-command commits, pushes, and PRs.

### Commands

**/commit** - Auto-generated commit message

```bash
/commit
```

Claude analyzes your staged changes and generates an appropriate commit message following your repository's conventions.

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add src/components/Button.tsx tests/Button.test.tsx

# Let Claude commit with auto-generated message
/commit
```

**/commit-push-pr** - One-command workflow

```bash
/commit-push-pr
```

Combines commit + push + PR creation into a single command. Claude:

1. Analyzes changes
2. Generates commit message
3. Pushes to remote
4. Creates pull request with summary

Perfect for sprint-based workflows where documentation → commit → PR is a regular pattern.

**/clean_gone** - Clean up merged branches

```bash
/clean_gone
```

Removes local branches that have been merged and deleted on the remote.

<Callout type="success">
**Sprint Protocol:** Use `/commit-push-pr` at the end of sprint milestones to automatically document, commit, push, and create PR in one step.
</Callout>

## pr-review-toolkit

Comprehensive PR review with 6 specialized agents running in parallel.

### Command

**/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr** - Full PR analysis

```bash
/pr-review-toolkit:review-pr
```

Launches 6 specialized agents:

1. **comment-analyzer** - Reviews code comment quality
2. **pr-test-analyzer** - Analyzes test coverage
3. **silent-failure-hunter** - Finds error handling gaps
4. **type-design-analyzer** - Reviews TypeScript/type system design
5. **code-reviewer** - General quality review
6. **code-simplifier** - Identifies over-engineering

### The code-simplifier Agent

Aligns with the "avoid over-engineering" principle:

- Flags unnecessary abstractions
- Identifies premature optimization
- Suggests simpler implementations
- Questions overly complex patterns

**Example findings:**

- "This helper function is only used once - inline it?"
- "Feature flag adds complexity - just change the code directly"
- "These 3 lines don't need a utility function"

<Callout type="info">
**Multi-Repo Use:** Run this on PRs across all your repositories for consistent review quality.
</Callout>

### When to Use

- Before requesting human PR review
- On your own PRs before submitting
- When reviewing teammate PRs (supplement your review)
- For large refactoring PRs (catches issues early)

## feature-dev

Structured 7-phase feature development workflow with automatic documentation.

### Command

**/feature-dev** - Guided feature development

```bash
/feature-dev
```

Interactive workflow that guides you through:

**Phase 1: Understand** - Clarify requirements
- Asks questions to understand scope
- Identifies ambiguities
- Defines success criteria

**Phase 2: Explore** - Examine codebase
- Searches for existing patterns
- Identifies related code
- Maps dependencies

**Phase 3: Design** - Plan implementation
- Proposes architecture
- Considers trade-offs
- Outlines approach

**Phase 4: Plan** - Break down tasks
- Creates step-by-step plan
- Identifies files to modify
- Estimates complexity

**Phase 5: Implement** - Write code
- Implements feature
- Follows established patterns
- Maintains code quality

**Phase 6: Test** - Verify functionality
- Writes tests
- Runs test suite
- Validates coverage

**Phase 7: Document** - Update docs
- Updates `.claude/implementation_progress.md`
- Adds inline documentation
- Creates user-facing docs

<Callout type="success">
**Auto-Documentation:** Phase 7 aligns with your "Documentation is Part of Done" protocol - the feature isn't complete until docs are updated.
</Callout>

### Perfect For

- Complex features requiring planning
- Cross-repo patterns (applying same feature to multiple repos)
- Features with unclear requirements
- Sprint-based development workflows

### Example Use Case

```bash
# In your knowledge-base repository
/feature-dev

# Claude asks: "What feature would you like to develop?"
# You respond: "Add user authentication with session management"

# Claude then:
# - Explores existing auth patterns in your codebase
# - Proposes JWT vs session-based approach
# - Creates implementation plan
# - Implements with tests
# - Documents in .claude/implementation_progress.md
```

<Callout type="info">
**Agents Included:** The feature-dev plugin includes `code-explorer`, `code-architect`, and `code-reviewer` agents that work together throughout the workflow.
</Callout>

## When to Use Each

| Plugin | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| **commit-commands** | Every commit, end of sprint milestones, PR creation |
| **pr-review-toolkit** | Before submitting PRs, reviewing others' PRs, large refactors |
| **feature-dev** | Complex features, unclear requirements, cross-repo patterns |

All three plugins are self-guided - they prompt you for information and walk you through the process. No complex configuration needed!
