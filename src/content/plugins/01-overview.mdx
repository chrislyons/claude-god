## What are Claude Code Plugins?

Plugins extend Claude Code's functionality by adding new commands, skills, agents, hooks, and integrations to your CLI experience. They're modular extensions that integrate seamlessly into your workflow.

### Plugin Component Types

Claude Code supports **6 component types** that plugins can provide:

**Commands:**
- Slash commands you can invoke directly
- Examples: `/commit`, `/config`, `/agents`
- Custom commands in `.claude/commands/` directory
- Available via tab completion
- Plugin commands use namespace: `/plugin-name:command-name`

**Skills:**
- Auto-invoked based on semantic matching of request to description
- Located in `skills/` directories with `SKILL.md` files
- Claude autonomously decides when to use them
- Examples: Code review, PDF processing, explaining code
- Can restrict tools via `allowed-tools` in frontmatter

**Agents:**
- Specialized subprocesses for complex tasks
- Custom agents in `.claude/agents/` directory
- Built-in agents: Plan, Explore, General-purpose
- Run independently with their own tool access and model
- Support progressive disclosure and skill inheritance

**Hooks:**
- Lifecycle event handlers (9 event types)
- Events: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, PermissionRequest, UserPromptSubmit, Notification, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact, SessionStart, SessionEnd
- Can modify tool inputs, block operations, or add context
- Support command-based, prompt-based, and agent-based hooks
- Configuration in `hooks/hooks.json` or inline in `plugin.json`

**MCP Servers:**
- Model Context Protocol server definitions
- Expose tools that Claude can use
- Configuration in `.mcp.json` or inline in plugin
- Environment variable substitution supported
- Examples: GitHub, Sentry, PostgreSQL integrations

**LSP Servers:**
- Language Server Protocol for code intelligence
- Provides diagnostics, code navigation, hover info, type information
- Configuration in `.lsp.json` or inline in plugin
- Official plugins: `pyright-lsp`, `typescript-lsp`, `rust-lsp`
- Custom transport mechanisms supported

### Built-in Agents

Claude Code ships with three powerful built-in agents:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Agent</th>
  <th>Model</th>
  <th>Purpose</th>
  <th>Tools</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Plan</strong></td>
  <td>Sonnet</td>
  <td>Research and planning before implementation</td>
  <td>Read, Glob, Grep, Bash (read-only)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>Explore</strong></td>
  <td>Haiku</td>
  <td>Fast, read-only code exploration</td>
  <td>Glob, Grep, Read, Bash (read-only)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>General-purpose</strong></td>
  <td>Sonnet</td>
  <td>Complex multi-step research and modification</td>
  <td>All tools</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Benefits for Multi-Repo Workflows

If you're managing multiple projects in a multi-repository setup, plugins provide:

- **Consistency:** Same workflows across all repos via shared plugins
- **Automation:** Reduce repetitive tasks with custom commands and skills
- **Integration:** Connect to external tools via MCP servers
- **Intelligence:** Language-specific support via LSP servers
- **Control:** Enforce patterns and policies via hooks
- **Extensibility:** Build custom agents for specialized tasks

### Real-World Plugin Examples

**Official LSP Plugins:**
- `pyright-lsp` - Python type checking and code intelligence
- `typescript-lsp` - TypeScript language support
- `rust-lsp` - Rust language server integration

**Community MCP Servers:**
- GitHub - Issue tracking, PR management
- Sentry - Error monitoring and debugging
- PostgreSQL - Database query and schema exploration

**Custom Skills:**
- Code review automation
- PDF processing (extract, fill forms, merge)
- Commit message generation
- Code explanation with diagrams

<Callout type="info">
**Plugin Distribution:** Plugins can be distributed via GitHub repositories, Git URLs, NPM packages, local file paths, or HTTP URLs. The Claude Code marketplace provides discovery and installation.
