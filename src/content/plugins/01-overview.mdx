## What are Claude Code Plugins?

Plugins extend Claude Code's functionality by adding new commands, skills, agents, and hooks to your CLI experience. They're modular extensions that integrate seamlessly into your workflow.

### Plugin Types

**Commands:**
- Slash commands you can invoke directly
- Examples: `/commit`, `/ralph-loop`, `/hookify`
- Available via tab completion

**Skills:**
- Auto-invoked based on file patterns or user actions
- Examples: `frontend-design` (triggers on frontend work)
- Contextual assistance without manual activation

**Agents:**
- Specialized subprocesses for complex tasks
- Examples: `code-reviewer`, `comment-analyzer`
- Run in parallel for comprehensive analysis

**Hooks:**
- Lifecycle event handlers
- Examples: PreToolUse (security-guidance), SessionStart, Stop (ralph-wiggum)
- Automatic behavior modification

### Benefits for Multi-Repo Workflows

If you're managing multiple projects (like the 6-repo setup: carbon-acx, hotbox, orpheus-sdk, wordbird, helm, undone), plugins provide:

- **Consistency:** Same workflows across all repos
- **Automation:** Reduce repetitive tasks (commits, reviews, refactoring)
- **Enforcement:** Prevent mistakes before they happen (hookify)
- **Speed:** Autonomous iteration loops (ralph-wiggum)
- **Quality:** Automated PR reviews with specialized agents

**Simple vs Complex:** Some plugins work automatically (security-guidance, frontend-design), while others require understanding best practices (ralph-wiggum, hookify). This guide covers both.
