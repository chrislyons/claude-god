## What is Claude Agent SDK?

The **Claude Agent SDK** is Anthropic's official framework for building AI agents with Claude that you can use **programmatically** (in Python or Node.js/TypeScript). Think of it as the "programmable version" of Claude Code.

### Key Purpose

Instead of typing commands into Claude Code's CLI, you write code that:

- Creates agents that run autonomously
- Gives them specific tools and constraints
- Handles their responses programmatically
- Integrates with your applications

### Core Analogy

- **Claude Code CLI** — Interactive tool you run in your terminal (human-driven)
- **Agent SDK** — Framework you import into your code (automation-driven)

Both use the same underlying Claude Code runtime and tools, but the SDK lets you integrate agents into applications, CI/CD pipelines, scheduled jobs, and custom workflows.

If you've been using Claude Code CLI for months, you already understand the concepts. The SDK just lets you automate them programmatically instead of typing interactively.
