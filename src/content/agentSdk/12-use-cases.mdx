## What Can You Build With Agent SDK?

### Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case | Example | Why Agent SDK |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Code Analysis Agents** | Find bugs, refactor, add tests | Runs autonomously on repos |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Run PR reviews, tests, linting | Automated, no user interaction |
| **Email Assistants** | Process emails, draft responses | Continuous background operation |
| **Research Agents** | Gather info, summarize findings | Multi-step autonomous tasks |
| **Document Generation** | Create reports, specs, docs | Driven by external data |
| **Scheduled Tasks** | Nightly data processing | Cron-compatible, headless |
| **Chat Interfaces** | Build conversational apps | Multi-turn with state |
| **Slack/Discord Bots** | Slack commands, interactions | Event-driven automation |
| **Web Dashboard** | Backend agent for web apps | REST API wrapper around agents |

### Key Capabilities

The SDK supports:

- **Tool use**: Read files, write code, run bash, search web, fetch URLs, edit notebooks
- **Sessions**: Multi-turn conversations with context retention
- **Permissions**: Fine-grained control over what agents can do
- **Hooks**: Intercept and modify behavior at key points
- **MCP servers**: Connect to external APIs, databases, services
- **Subagents**: Delegate tasks to specialized agents
- **Structured outputs**: Get predictable JSON results
- **Extended thinking**: Complex reasoning tasks
- **Streaming**: Real-time output delivery
