## How Does It Relate to Claude Code CLI?

### The Relationship

<MermaidDiagram diagram={`graph TB
    A[Claude API]
    B[Agent SDK]
    C[Claude Code CLI]

    A --> B
    B --> C

    style A fill:#FAF9F6,stroke:#F55036,stroke-width:2px,color:#2D2926
    style B fill:#FAF9F6,stroke:#F55036,stroke-width:2px,color:#2D2926
    style C fill:#FAF9F6,stroke:#F55036,stroke-width:2px,color:#2D2926`} />

The Agent SDK:

1. **Requires Claude Code CLI** to be installed (acts as the runtime)
2. **Builds on top of the Claude API** for model interactions
3. **Provides a higher-level abstraction** than raw API calls (like Express vs raw Node HTTP)
4. **Handles tool orchestration** (Read, Write, Bash, WebSearch, etc.) automatically

### Can You Use Both Together?

**Yes, absolutely.** They're complementary:

- Use **Claude Code CLI** for interactive development and debugging
- Use **Agent SDK** for automation, integrations, and programmatic workflows

<MermaidDiagram diagram={`sequenceDiagram
    actor Dev as Developer
    participant CLI as Claude Code CLI
    participant SDK as Agent SDK
    participant Prod as CI/CD and Scheduled Jobs

    Dev->>CLI: Test agent manually
    CLI->>Dev: Show results
    Dev->>SDK: Convert to SDK
    SDK->>SDK: Write Python/TypeScript
    SDK->>Prod: Deploy
    Prod->>Prod: Run autonomously`} />

<Callout type="success" title="Best Practice">
Use this workflow: Develop with CLI → Test behavior → Convert to SDK → Deploy to production
</Callout>
