## When to Use Agent SDK vs Claude Code CLI

### Quick Comparison

| Scenario | Use | Why |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Interactive terminal development | Claude Code CLI | Real-time feedback, manual testing |
| Python/Node application integration | Agent SDK | Programmatic control, automation |
| CI/CD pipelines | Agent SDK | Headless execution, automated workflows |
| Chat/conversational interfaces | Agent SDK with ClaudeSDKClient | Multi-turn context retention |
| Background/scheduled jobs | Agent SDK | Cron-compatible, no user interaction |
| Quick one-off tasks | Either | CLI faster for ad-hoc, SDK for repeatability |
| Debugging and prototyping | Claude Code CLI → Agent SDK | Develop interactively, deploy programmatically |

### Recommended Workflow

<Callout type="success" title="Best Practice">
1. **Develop** with Claude Code CLI for interactive testing
2. **Test** behavior and iterate quickly
3. **Convert** to Agent SDK for automation
4. **Deploy** to production environments
</Callout>

### When to Choose CLI

- Learning and experimenting
- Manual code reviews
- Interactive debugging sessions
- Quick file operations
- Testing agent capabilities

### When to Choose SDK

- Building applications (web apps, APIs, services)
- Automation (CI/CD, scheduled tasks, batch processing)
- Custom integrations (Slack bots, Discord bots, dashboards)
- Multi-turn conversations with state
- Production deployments requiring programmatic control
