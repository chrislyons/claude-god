## Research Workflows

### Source Quality Verification

**Check citation quality against hierarchy:**

```bash
claude "Read chapter-draft.md. Categorize each source by tier:

  • Tier 1 (Primary): archives, government docs, original data
  • Tier 2 (Academic): peer-reviewed journals, university press
  • Tier 3 (Secondary): well-documented analytical work
  • Tier 4 (Use sparingly): journalism, opinion

Flag Tier 4 sources used for factual claims. Suggest Tier 1-2 alternatives"
```

**Verify IEEE citation format:**

```bash
claude "Audit thesis.md for IEEE citation compliance:

  1. Check inline format: [n], [12][13], [8]-[11]
  2. Verify References section has: Author, 'Title,' Publication, Date, URL
  3. Confirm citation numbers match first appearance order
  4. Flag any broken or inaccessible URLs

Generate compliance report"
```

### Literature Review with Standards

**Systematic source gathering:**

```bash
claude "Research 'carbon accounting methodology 1990-2010':

  1. Search Google Scholar, JSTOR, archive.org
  2. Prioritize: peer-reviewed articles, government reports, primary data
  3. For each source: extract title, authors, year, venue, DOI/URL
  4. Create annotated bibliography with:
       • Source tier (1-4)
       • Key findings (2-3 sentences)
       • Relevance to carbon accounting methodology
       • Citation quality assessment

Save as literature-review.md with IEEE format"
```

**Cross-reference verification:**

```bash
claude "Read sources.md (contains 15 papers on monetary policy).

For claim: 'Central banks increased rates 12 times between 2000-2005'

  1. Identify which sources support this claim
  2. Check if numbers match across sources
  3. Flag discrepancies
  4. Assess: Do we have 2+ independent sources? (minimum standard)

Generate verification report"
```

### Dual-Reader Design Testing

**Test scannable path:**

```bash
claude "Audit chapter03.md for dual-reader compliance:

CURSORY PATH (15-30 min):
  • Can reader get core argument from: Executive Frame → headers → Synthesis?
  • Test: Read only those sections. Does thesis flow make sense?

DETAILED PATH (2-4 hours):
  • Full evidence and citations
  • Follow 'Analytic note:' sections

Report: Do both paths work independently? Flag sections that break either path"
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Dual-Reader Standard">
Both reading paths must be complete and coherent on their own. Cursory readers should get the thesis without reading evidence. Detailed readers should see explicit analytical connections.
</Callout>

### Thesis Connection Analysis

**Generate "Analytic note:" sections:**

```bash
claude "Read chapter-draft.md.

For each major section of evidence:

  1. Identify the factual claim or pattern documented
  2. Generate an 'Analytic note:' paragraph explaining:
       • How this evidence connects to core thesis
       • What it reveals about the larger argument
       • Why this matters for the overall narrative

Insert 'Analytic note:' sections after each evidence block.
Ensure explicit connection, no assumed leaps"
```

### Counter-Evidence and Critique

**Test argument strength:**

```bash
claude "Read thesis-chapter.md. Play adversarial critic:

  1. Identify central claims
  2. Search for counter-evidence that challenges each claim
  3. Find contradictory data, alternative interpretations
  4. Assess: Are counter-arguments addressed? If not, flag as weakness
  5. Suggest how to strengthen argument against critique

Generate adversarial review report"
```

**Detect retrospective bias:**

```bash
claude "Audit historical-analysis.md for teleological reasoning:

Flag any language suggesting:
  • Inevitability ('had to happen', 'naturally led to')
  • Predetermined outcomes ('destined', 'inevitable')
  • Retrospective justification (explaining past by future)

For each flag: suggest neutral phrasing that preserves contingency"
```

### Citation Management

**Build bibliography from PDFs:**

```bash
claude "Process all PDFs in ./sources/:

  1. Extract: Author, Title, Publication, Year, DOI/URL
  2. Categorize by source tier (1-4)
  3. Format as IEEE citations
  4. Sort by: tier (1-4), then chronologically
  5. Generate bibliography.md with quality ratings

For any source missing DOI/URL: flag as inaccessible"
```

**Cross-verify contested claims:**

```bash
claude "Claim: 'Manufacturing employment fell 40% in 1980-2000'

Required: Minimum 2 independent Tier 1-2 sources

  1. Search: government labor statistics, academic studies
  2. Find: 2+ sources confirming this figure
  3. Check: Do numbers match exactly? If variance, document range
  4. Assess: Source independence (not citing each other)

Generate verification report with citations"
```
