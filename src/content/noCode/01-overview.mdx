## Overview

Claude CLI and Agent SDK enable rigorous research, analysis, and documentation workflows **without programming**. Terminal commands and copy-paste scripts only.

### Core Capabilities

**Research Automation**

- Academic literature review and synthesis
- Source verification and citation management
- Cross-reference validation
- Evidence gathering from primary sources

**Document Quality**

- IEEE citation verification
- Dual-reader design testing (scannable + detailed paths)
- Logical argument structure analysis
- Counter-evidence identification

**Content Analysis**

- Extract structured data from unstructured sources
- Thematic categorization
- Comparative analysis across documents
- Pattern recognition in large corpora

**Workflow Automation**

- Batch document processing with quality standards
- Scheduled research digests
- Automated compliance checking
- Reproducible analytical pipelines

### Two Execution Modes

**1. Interactive CLI (Immediate Tasks)**

```bash
claude "Verify all IEEE citations in thesis.md match source URLs. Flag discrepancies"
```

Single-command execution for ad-hoc tasks.

**2. Agent Scripts (Complex Workflows)**

Copy-paste Python/TypeScript scripts with customization points marked `<-- CUSTOMIZE`. No code comprehension required.

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
- Claude Code installed (`brew install --cask claude-code`)
- Basic terminal navigation (`cd`, `ls`, run commands)
- For scripts: Python 3.8+ or Node.js 18+
</Callout>

### Quality Standards

This guide emphasizes:

- **Reproducibility** — Scripts document methodology
- **Verification** — Built-in quality checks
- **Standards compliance** — IEEE citations, dual-reader design
- **Transparency** — No black-box operations

### Structure

- **Research Workflows** — Academic research, literature review, source management
- **Writing Automation** — Thesis development, analytical framework, citation management
- **Document Processing** — Batch operations, format conversion, quality assurance
- **Data Analysis** — Statistical summaries, trend analysis, reporting
- **Web Research** — Systematic source gathering, monitoring, verification
- **Automation Scripts** — Production-ready agents for recurring tasks
