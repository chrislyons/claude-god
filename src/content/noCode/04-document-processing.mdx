## Document Processing

### Batch File Operations

**Rename files based on content:**

```bash
claude "Read each PDF in ./invoices/. Rename to format: YYYY-MM-DD_VendorName_Amount.pdf based on the invoice content"
```

**Organize files into folders:**

```bash
claude "Scan all documents in this directory. Create folders by category (contracts, invoices, reports, misc). Move files to appropriate folders based on content"
```

### Data Extraction

**Extract information from PDFs:**

```bash
claude "Read all PDFs in ./receipts/. Extract: date, vendor, amount, category. Save as expenses.csv"
```

**Parse structured documents:**

```bash
claude "Read contract.pdf. Extract key terms: parties involved, effective date, termination date, payment terms, obligations. Save as contract-summary.md"
```

### Format Conversion

**Convert to markdown:**

```bash
claude "Convert report.docx to clean markdown. Preserve headings, lists, tables, and emphasis. Save as report.md"
```

**Create plain text from complex documents:**

```bash
claude "Extract all text from presentation.pptx. Organize by slide number with slide titles. Save as presentation-transcript.txt"
```

### Document Analysis

**Compare versions:**

```bash
claude "Compare contract-v1.pdf and contract-v2.pdf. List all changes, additions, and deletions. Highlight significant legal differences"
```

**Identify missing information:**

```bash
claude "Read application-form.pdf. List all required fields that are blank or incomplete"
```

### Document Generation

**Create reports from data:**

```bash
claude "Read metrics.json. Generate a formatted PDF-ready markdown report with charts described in text, summary statistics, and trend analysis"
```

**Merge multiple documents:**

```bash
claude "Combine intro.md, methods.md, results.md, and conclusion.md into a single cohesive document. Add transitions between sections. Save as full-report.md"
```

### Batch Processing Workflows

**Process invoice batch:**

```bash
claude "For each PDF in ./incoming-invoices/: 1) Extract vendor, date, amount, items; 2) Verify totals are correct; 3) Flag any discrepancies; 4) Move processed files to ./processed/; 5) Save summary to invoice-log.csv"
```

**Document quality check:**

```bash
claude "Scan all .docx files in ./submissions/. Check each for: required sections, proper formatting, reference completeness. Generate quality-report.md with pass/fail status for each document"
```

### Archive Management

**Create document index:**

```bash
claude "Scan ./archive/ recursively. For each document, extract: filename, date created, document type, key subjects/entities mentioned. Save as archive-index.csv"
```

**Summarize old records:**

```bash
claude "Read all documents in ./2020-records/. Create a year-end summary covering: major events, key decisions, outstanding items. Save as 2020-summary.md"
```
