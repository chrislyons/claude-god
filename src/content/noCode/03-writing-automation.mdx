## Writing & Content Creation

### Drafting Content

```

```

### Editing & Refinement

**Improve clarity and conciseness:**

```bash
claude "Edit draft.md for clarity. Remove jargon, shorten sentences, and improve flow. Preserve all technical details. Save to draft-v2.md"
```

**Check consistency:**

```bash
claude "Read style-guide.md and article.md. Ensure the article follows the style guide's rules for tone, terminology, and formatting. List violations and suggest fixes"
```

```

### Multi-Document Writing Projects
