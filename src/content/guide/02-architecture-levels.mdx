## Architecture Levels

### User Level (~/.claude/)

Personal configuration that applies to **all projects** you work on.
This is your private workspace for automation, skills, and preferences.

<DirectoryTree content={`~/.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md                   # Global rules
├── settings.json               # User settings & permissions
├── agents/                     # Personal automation agents
│   ├── doc-syncer.md
│   ├── git-workflow-agent.md
│   └── workspace-test-runner.md
├── skills/                     # Personal workflow skills
│   ├── context-review.md
│   ├── qcheck.md
│   ├── sprint-complete.md
│   └── sprint-report.md
├── guides/                     # Reference documentation
│   └── claude-agent-sdk-guide.html
└── maintenance/                # Session workflows
    ├── session-start.md
    ├── session-end.md
    └── monthly-review.md`} />

<Callout type="success" title="✅ What Goes at User Level">
  - Personal workflow automation (skills, agents)
  - Session management workflows
  - Global permissions and model preferences
  - Reference guides for personal use
  - Anything that applies across *all* your projects
</Callout>

### Repo Level (&lt;repo&gt;/.claude/)

Team-shared configuration committed to git. This is the **official project configuration**
that all collaborators inherit when they clone the repository.

<DirectoryTree content={`<repo>/.claude/
├── settings.json               # Team settings (committed)
├── settings.local.json         # Personal overrides (gitignored)
├── agents/                     # Project-specific agents
│   ├── citation-validator.md
│   └── deployment-orchestrator.md
├── skills/                     # Project-specific skills
│   └── manifest.json
└── scratch/                    # Temporary workspace (gitignored)`} />

<Callout type="success" title="✅ What Goes at Repo Level">
  - Project-specific agents (e.g., citation validator for docs-heavy repos)
  - Team-shared skills and workflows
  - Default permissions for the project
  - Anything the entire team should share
</Callout>

### Local Level (&lt;repo&gt;/.claude/*.local.*)

Personal overrides for a specific project. These files are **gitignored** and never committed.

```plaintext
settings.local.json    # Personal permission overrides
CLAUDE.local.md        # Personal notes about the project
scratch/               # Temporary files
```

<Callout type="success" title="✅ What Goes at Local Level">
  - Personal permission exceptions for this project
  - Private notes or reminders
  - Temporary files and scratch work
  - Anything personal that shouldn't affect the team
</Callout>

### Workspace Level (~/dev/CLAUDE.md)

A special case: your workspace can have a `CLAUDE.md` at the root to define conventions
that apply to all repos in that directory. **Important:** No `.claude/` directory
at workspace level - only a CLAUDE.md file.

<Callout type="warning" title="⚠️ Workspace .claude/ Removed">
  Previous architecture had `~/dev/.claude/` as a custom workspace layer.
  This has been **eliminated** to follow official best practices.
  Workspace-level content was migrated to user level or distributed to repos.
</Callout>
