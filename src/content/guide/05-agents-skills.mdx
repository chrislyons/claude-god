## Agents & Skills

### Where to Put Agents

| Agent Type | Location | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Personal automation | ~/.claude/agents/ | git-workflow-agent, doc-syncer |
| Project-specific | &lt;repo&gt;/.claude/agents/ | citation-validator, deployment-orchestrator |
| Domain-specific | &lt;repo&gt;/.claude/agents/ | data-analyzer (for data-pipeline) |

### Agent Format Requirements

All agents must use **Markdown with YAML frontmatter**:

```yaml
---
name: my-agent
version: 1.0.0
description: Brief description of what this agent does
tools:
  - Read
  - Bash
  - Grep
when_to_use: When to invoke this agent
---

# Agent Name

Agent documentation and instructions go here...
```

### Skill Discovery

Skills are discovered from two locations:

- **User-level:** `~/.claude/skills/` (personal workflow automation)
- **Repo-level:** `<repo>/.claude/skills/` (project-specific tools)

<Callout type="info" title="💡 Trigger Keywords">
  Skills are automatically suggested based on keywords in your requests:

  - **audit/review** → evaluation skills
  - **implement/create** → generation skills
  - **check/validate** → validation skills
  - **analyze** → analysis skills
  - **generate report** → reporting skills
</Callout>

### Distribution Strategy

The migration distributed agents based on relevance:

- **citation-validator** → 6 repos (all repos with documentation)
- **deployment-orchestrator** → multiple repos (data-pipeline, dict-app, landing-page)
- **git-workflow-agent** → User level (applies to all repos)
