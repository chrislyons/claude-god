## Agents & Skills

### Where to Put Agents

| Agent Type | Location | Example |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Personal automation | ~/.claude/agents/ | git-workflow-agent, doc-syncer |
| Project-specific | &lt;repo&gt;/.claude/agents/ | citation-validator, deployment-orchestrator |
| Domain-specific | &lt;repo&gt;/.claude/agents/ | data-analyzer (for data-pipeline) |

### Agent Format Requirements

All agents must use **Markdown with YAML frontmatter**:

```yaml
---
name: my-agent
description: Brief description of what this agent does and when to use it
tools: Read, Bash, Grep
model: sonnet
permissionMode: default
---

# Agent Name

System prompt and instructions for the agent go here...
This defines the agent's role, expertise, and approach.
```

**Required fields:**
- `name` - Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens)
- `description` - What the agent does AND when to invoke it (max 1024 chars)

**Optional fields:**
- `tools` - Comma-separated list; if omitted, inherits all parent tools
- `model` - sonnet, opus, haiku, or 'inherit' (defaults to sonnet)
- `permissionMode` - default, acceptEdits, dontAsk, bypassPermissions, plan, ignore
- `skills` - Comma-separated list of skills to load for this agent

### Skill Discovery

Skills are discovered from two locations:

- **User-level:** `~/.claude/skills/` (personal workflow automation)
- **Repo-level:** `<repo>/.claude/skills/` (project-specific tools)

<Callout type="info" title="Trigger Keywords">
  Skills are automatically suggested based on keywords in your requests:

  - **audit/review** → evaluation skills
  - **implement/create** → generation skills
  - **check/validate** → validation skills
  - **analyze** → analysis skills
  - **generate report** → reporting skills
</Callout>

### Distribution Strategy

The migration distributed agents based on relevance:

- **citation-validator** → 6 repos (all repos with documentation)
- **deployment-orchestrator** → multiple repos (data-pipeline, dict-app, landing-page)
- **git-workflow-agent** → User level (applies to all repos)
