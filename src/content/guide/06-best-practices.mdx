## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Level

<Callout type="success" title="DO: Use User Level For...">
  - Personal workflow automation (skills you use everywhere)
  - Global permissions (commands you always want allowed)
  - Session management workflows
  - Personal reference guides and documentation
  - Model preferences and plugin settings
</Callout>

<Callout type="success" title="DO: Use Repo Level For...">
  - Project-specific agents (e.g., citation validator for docs repos)
  - Team-shared skills and workflows
  - Default project permissions
  - Configuration all collaborators should inherit
</Callout>

<Callout type="success" title="DO: Use Local Level For...">
  - Personal permission overrides for a specific project
  - Private notes about the project
  - Temporary files and scratch work
  - Experimental settings you don't want to share
</Callout>

<Callout type="danger" title="DON'T: Common Mistakes">
  - Don't create workspace-level .claude/ directories
  - Don't commit settings.local.json to git
  - Don't duplicate agents across repos if they're truly personal
  - Don't put team-shared config in user-level files
  - Don't put personal preferences in repo-level settings.json
</Callout>

### Naming Conventions

- **Agents:** `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `citation-validator.md`)
- **Skills:** `kebab-case.md` (e.g., `sprint-complete.md`)
- **Settings:** `settings.json` (team) or `settings.local.json` (personal)

### Version Control

<Callout type="info" title="What to Commit">
  **Commit to git:**

  - `CLAUDE.md` (repo rules)
  - `.claude/settings.json` (team settings)
  - `.claude/agents/*.md` (team-shared agents)
  - `.claude/skills/` (team-shared skills)

  **Never commit:**

  - `.claude/settings.local.json`
  - `.claude/CLAUDE.local.md`
  - `.claude/scratch/`
</Callout>
