## Examples

### Creating a User-Level Skill

Create a personal workflow skill at `~/.claude/skills/my-skill.md`:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
version: 1.0.0
description: My personal workflow automation
when_to_use: When I need to do X across all projects
---

# My Skill

Instructions for this skill...
```

### Adding a Repo-Specific Agent

For a project that needs custom validation:

```bash
# Create agent directory
mkdir -p ~/dev/my-project/.claude/agents

# Create agent file
cat > ~/dev/my-project/.claude/agents/custom-validator.md << 'EOF'
---
name: custom-validator
version: 1.0.0
description: Project-specific validation rules
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
when_to_use: Before commits in this project
---

# Custom Validator

Validation logic for this project...
EOF

# Commit to git so team gets it
git add .claude/agents/custom-validator.md
git commit -m "Add custom validator agent"
```

### Setting Up Local Overrides

Override permissions for a specific project:

```bash
# Create local override
cat > ~/dev/my-project/.claude/settings.local.json << 'EOF'
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(rm -rf dist/)",
      "Bash(docker-compose down -v)"
    ]
  }
}
EOF

# This file is gitignored - won't be committed
```

### Multi-Repo Workflow

Working across multiple repos with consistent tooling:

1. **User level:** Create git-workflow-agent.md for commit/PR automation
2. **Each repo:** Add repo-specific settings.json with project permissions
3. **Local overrides:** Add settings.local.json in repos where you need exceptions
