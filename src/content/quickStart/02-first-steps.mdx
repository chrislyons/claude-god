## First Steps

### Authenticate

Run Claude Code for the first time:

```bash
claude
```

Follow the authentication prompts to connect to your Claude account.

### Your First Command

Try asking Claude to help with something simple:

```bash
claude "Create a hello.txt file with 'Hello World'"
```

**Windows (PowerShell):** If double quotes cause issues, use:
```powershell
claude 'Create a hello.txt file with "Hello World"'
```

Claude will:
1. Understand your request
2. Use the Write tool to create the file
3. Ask for your approval (unless you're in auto-approve mode)
4. Execute the action

<Callout type="success" title="Success!">
You've just used Claude Code to automate a task. This is the foundation of everything Claude Code can do.
</Callout>

### Explore Your Environment

Claude Code can see your current directory and project structure. Try:

```bash
claude "What files are in this directory?"
```

Claude will use file system tools to explore and report back.
